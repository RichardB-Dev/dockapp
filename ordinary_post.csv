"Minutiae - the anti-social media app free from likes, comments, or profiles.","Hello folks,

Even though we take more photos than ever most of them are special moments - birthdays, dinner with friends, playing with our pets, etc.   


However, **99.9% of our lives go undocumented** because these moments seem too mundane or ordinary to be worthy of documentation.  


My co-creator and I created minutiae, an app the “forces” you to document these moments - before it’s too late. 

This is how it works:

* Once a day **at the exact same minute** all participants around the world receive a daily alert. 
* At the alert, you have **one minute to capture** whatever is in front of you there and then. 
* The result is thousands of complete strangers capturing ordinary moments of their life at the exact same time together creating a global ritual of self-documentation. 

Once you have captured your moment you have a one-minute window to view your own timeline of previously taken photos or with the tap of a button get matched with a complete stranger. The experience offers a **highly intimate view into a stranger’s life** before the app closes down and the process is repeated again the following day at a different minute. 

The project continues for 1440 days until every single minute in a day has been captured creating a highly unique journal of what ***really*** ***happened in life*** as opposed to what we tend to remember. 

The project has been called:

My Mac Mini order was cancelled by Apple because an update is expected soon,"We ordered a Mac Mini for me at work 3 weeks ago. The delivery date kept being pushed back (since it has 16Gb RAM it's a custom made order) until today where we received a text from Apple. The order has been canceled because a update of this product is expected soon (they encourage us to place another order later).

I'm just posting that here so you know (it seems you can still buy a Mac Mini that's in stock, but if I were you I would just wait a few weeks). It's worth noting that I'm in France we ordered online on the french Apple website.

**Edit:** Some people are asking that I post a screenshot of the text. I honestly wasn't expecting:

- the whole thing to be something out of the ordinary
- so many people answering and being surprised

The text was received by my boss, I didn't read it. When he told me about it he said he deleted it manually. I'll ask tomorrow again if he's sure of what he read and if somehow he can still retrieve the text to check it again.

**Edit 2:** I had a discussion with my 2 bosses involved in ordering the Mac and the exact reason was (in the email, in french) ""Reconstruction de gamme"" (which means something like ""rebuilding the range [of Mac Minis I guess]"").

And yes, Apple did cancel the order (weird indeed), my boss got a refund and got told (by email) that he can either order something not custom (in stock) or either wait to be recontacted later by Apple.

Another hint that something is happening is that when you order on the website (at least on the french store), a fully maxed Mac Mini is advertised to be delivered in **2-3 days** but when you do the ""delivery date simulation"" (or whatever you call it in english) it actually goes to **16-20 October!** (see the screenshot below for proof)

Try it yourself if you don't believe me: http://www.apple.com/fr/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini?product=MGEN2F/A&step=config#

So you can order something in stock straigthaway but as soon as you want something custom you have crazy delays.

And no I didn't ask to see the email, I do trust them (they wouldn't be the kind of people to lie about that, and one is quite a follower of Apple news and very surprised and intrigued about that too). They even offered to re-order today (for delivery on 16-20 Oct) or even order one that's in stock, but I'd rather wait a week or too and see (I don't want to miss any update).",317,194,1444241047.0
The best 3D touch feature on iPhone (my opinion),"Having just switched over from the iPhone 6 to X, I've been learning a lot of 3D touch features as I've gone along.
By far I feel that having the ability to use the keyboard as a trackpad to move the cursor is the best feature. I've never really loved having to pinpoint the cursor with my finger and this is a much smoother and efficient method.

If you have any other out of the ordinary 3D touch features let me know!",315,112,1511803239.0
Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer. You are welcome to feel however you want about that, but I personally am really fond of this approach. USB-C stuff is still *outrageously expensive,* but that doesn't mean it isn't superior (I believe it is, I'll take USB-PD over Magsafe any day). There are some of us out there that really love this computer. It's not all bad. 

I encourage all of you to get outside your comfort zone with your computers. We tend to not like going out of our ways to build new computing habits (I'm looking at you, all you traditional scrolling heathens /s), but the computer is a tool. Learn how you work best with it, and just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's a bad product. I happen to know that a large number of people, if not a majority, doesn't like this new keyboard, but it also seems to be related to how long you've been around computing. Be aware of that; sticks in the mud still use Windows XP and/or Tiger. 

I look forward rebuttal to the rebuttal :)",214,127,1518153995.0
