"Apple Plans a Slow, Appointment-Only Rollout of Its $3,500 Vision Pro",,328," For any Apple Retail employees out there, how does Apple handle training on new devices for you all? Do you get to hold or see anything beforehand or is it done right before opening on a launch day? Vision Pro seems like it has a lot of detail that would require more training than normal, but maybe it can be done quickly. Just curious, not sure how the Apple Watch was handled at the original launch.",1688727800.0

The company is discussing the UK and Canada as two of its first international markets with Asia and Europe soon after, although a final decision hasn’t been made, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing internal matters. Apple engineers are working to localize the device for France, Germany, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan and Korea, the people said.

>During testing of the device, Apple determined that some people with smaller body sizes and heads would struggle to wear the headset for more than half an hour or so, the amount of time the company let media members test the Vision Pro after its introduction. Apple looked to offset that issue with the recent development of a second strap that sits across the top of a user’s head. The design of that accessory isn’t finalized.

"Apple Plans a Slow, Appointment-Only Rollout of Its $3,500 Vision Pro",,328,"We had training for the Apple Watch before they were officially released. The only difference with the watch vs other new products is that we had the watches on display in-store a few weeks before they were released. The demo watches had a demo image on them that was *not* the full OS but instead a limited version of it. 

We had very specific training on how we were supposed to ask people for permission before putting the watch on them and needed to learn how all of the bands worked and how we were supposed to hold people’s wrists when putting the watch on.

There weren’t too many details given about the specific features and how the apps worked until *after* the launch of the watch. The training we got early was mainly the physical training on how the watch was supposed to be handled by employees. 

With all new devices the only people who get to see them in-store early are the visuals team. They’ll work an overnight shift the day before release to set up the demo units.

Unless there’s a display unit in store or any demo units before the launch of the device I doubt there will be any kind of extensive training before launch. 

There may be only creative pros or creatives that are trained on how to put on the device for customers to make the experience more “special”

I could easily see Apple making any interaction with the Vision Pro by appointment only and having each customer’s interaction be a special one on one with the device and an employee",1688727800.0
"Apple Plans a Slow, Appointment-Only Rollout of Its $3,500 Vision Pro",,328,"The original Apple Watch was much different to any iPhone launches, and I imagine the Vison will have a similar feel. 

A few people were chosen per store to go learn the try-on experience. Depending on the store they were either the only ones originally doing try-ons or their job was to teach others how to do the try-on experience.

With vision pro they are most likely doing the same thing. There are like hundreds of combinations based off of your face structure and they will use an app to scan your face to find out what your specific coded size is and your eye placement. Plus, if you add potential lens changes for prescriptions, there is an extra element to the timing.

It makes sense that it will start as an appointment only. This is not like an oculus or any other device before it. There are custom fittings so you’ll have to have an “expert” help make sure it’s comfortable",1688727800.0

They will be the ones then skilled to take the support calls once the product launches. 

This will happen in each of their regional HQ’s and it’s later this year, so before the product launches as such. First time I am aware of them doing something like this for a new product with support. Before this it was always just online based training modules.

"Apple Plans a Slow, Appointment-Only Rollout of Its $3,500 Vision Pro",,328,"I’m guessing they’ll get some, but not days. You mentioned Watch, and that is the right parallel: it’s not just new technology, but Vision Pro will require some training on physically putting an object on a customer’s head. For Watch, employees studied Rolex stores and other high-end buying experiences to understand how to put a watch on someone (since it required touching a customer, which was a big no-no until Watch and not expertise Apple previously had). TBD how functional the actual Vision Pro demo units will be (the initial Watch try-on units just played a video loop of its functionality but couldn’t actually be used). Assuming there is some level of functionality, just based on other 1.0 launches, the Retail employee probably won’t initially be able to see what the customer is looking at and may need to guide them to take certain actions. Stuff like that. But everyone will learn together, it should be a fun experience, and the try-on/demo flow will quickly evolve with some initial learning and more device availability.",1688727800.0

Few people, usually just the visual merchandising teams, would touch the designated demo units prior to setting them up, but we would usually get product details some training scenarios for sales beforehand. Techs would qualify as trainings became available on the learning system, but with new products the repairs were often WUR anyways.

All Apple Park employees getting standing desks because ‘sitting is the new cancer’,,523,"DPT student here. Just wanted to share my opinion on this. Sitting is not the problem. Standing CAN be “better” than sitting. Sitting CAN be “better” than standing. It is all such a case by case basis it’s a gross oversimplification to label a common every day position as a “cancer.”  In my opinion the problem lies more within the persons posture in those respective positions.

Think of it this way... if a person had pain with handwriting a letter with a pencil (we can relate this to sitting) you could give them one of those cushy pencil grippy things (we can relate this to standing) but they could still end up having the same pain after writing after several hours.  Why is this? Maybe they are holding the pencil with an awful grip and are putting stress on their joints way more than they have to. (We can relate this to posture.) You could show them a better way to hold their pencil and get much better outcomes in terms of pain reduction.

Alright. Now to get back to my original point and away from my awful attempt at an extended metaphor.

If you sit with terrible posture, hunched over with your head forward and shoulders rounded forward, you are constantly stressing the joints and muscles in your cervical spine and over time this could lead to health complications.  Furthermore, if you stand up at a desk but still have he same forward head and rounded shoulders when looking at a computer, not much is different than the sitting position. Furthermore, if you stand with your knees locked this could eventually cause some long term changes there as well.

So is standing “better”? Sure if you can stand with good posture but are unable to do that sitting... Is sitting “better”? Sure if you can sit with good posture but are unable to maintain that standing up.

The point is, sitting isn’t even remotely related to a heath “cancer” by any means.  Rather than applying these arbitrary labels, companies like Apple should focus more on properly educating employees on posture and offering opportunities to take breaks from sitting at their desks every so often to get up, move, and stretch.

TLDR: Posture is the issue. Not sitting.",1528975053.0

When you’re standing next to each other this is trivial to do: one person can pivot back onto their heel to make room for the other person to lean forward and point and say something. It’s like standing at a whiteboard together. There’s no way to get this while pulling up a chair to someone else’s desk.

Did I pay a premium?  I don't think so, and here's why:    

First, I've never seen a photo render as perfectly as on an Apple product.  Attribute this to what you want but, as an enthusiast who shoots solely in RAW, this is a huge plus.     

Second, the ability to deal with warranty and repair issues directly with the manufacturer is a rare opportunity and one not available to PC users.  Apple (with my Apple Care) will handle all repairs and issues for 3 years.  I've had two laptops suffer serious issues within 18 months (different issues) and only having the option to send it away via Best Buy or the like wasn't as appealing as going to the store of the manufacturer and getting an opinion and option right there.    

More than this, though, is the idea that a new and appealing OS environment that ""just works"" is too good to pass up.  I'm done with reg edits, re-working the services menu, jigging the start-up programs, etc.  I'd rather switch it on and get down to business.  I'm no neophyte when it comes to computers but I've reached a point where it's time to just use the machine.  Add in my love of the Apple feel after using my iPhone (this is after over 18 months with Android) and I am comfortable enough to switch the household towards a purely Apple experience.

So, we're basically admitting that although Apple computers 'are perfectly ordinary' we still can't make the same ordinary computer in a way that people will want to actually buy them. That's a compliment I want to get every day. I couldn't get enough of that kind of praise, no sir. ""So, ok, they're just ordinary computers, right? There's no big deal, right? I wish I could make an ordinary computer like that myself. But we couldn't.""

Apple has always been about the entire top-to-bottom experience. The hardware, the middleware, the system and the software. Together with great design and an understanding of what the customer wants, Apple creates a superior experience. That part, believe you me, is not ordinary. If it was ordinary, everybody would do it.

There was a link here the other day about the difference in tablet computers before and after iPad. It could not be more striking.

What HP is saying is simply: even after Apple showed us how it's done and what the customer wants, we -still- can't make one that people might actually be interested in. Put that in a frame and hang it on your wall, HP.

Roughly one year after entering the business, HP throws in the towel in abject defeat. Yet, what the competition makes is 'perfectly ordinary'.

Amateurs.

Edit: the market for these machines is so razor-thin that even with incredible customer service, Apple still manages to be the largest corporation [give or take 10 billion] in the US. They're practically a charity, how these people keep food on the table, nobody knows. [/sarcasm off]",1313803165.0

"""Only Apple has a brand that consumers perceive as so desirable that they are happy to pay a hefty premium for what in the end are perfectly ordinary computers.""  NO",,214,"A few points to make (admitted Windows-""fanboy"", though I'll be objective as possible):

1) Those who praise OS X's ""security"": I am currently pleased with Lion's security features. I am not pleased with how long it has taken to come this far. Only in Lion did Apple implement ASLR system wide, which has been an integral part of Windows since Vista. ASLR greatly reduces the risk of security exploits, and prior to Lion, I can confidently say Windows 7 was more secure.

Some cite the lack of extensive Mac malware as a sign of its security. It is not. It is a sign of its obscurity. A ""computer hacker"" is not interested in less than 10% of the worldwide base of computer users. It is much more compelling to release malware for Windows.

Furthermore, a huge majority of Windows malware is not viral exploits, but trojans, which no system, even OS X is immune to. It is a fault on the behalf of the end user, who installs pirated software, software from shady sources, or other such nonsense.

Effectively, yes, for now you are less likely to be targeted by malware. But it has been shown recently with ""MacDefender"" and whatnot that as OS X's market share grows, malware will emerge for the platform.

2) Display quality: Apple's displays in the iMac and MacBook Pros are good, but are not suited for professional use. The extensive use of WLED backlighting harshly limits the color gamut that the displays are able to represent. The MBP 13 and 15"" for example, are able to display approximately 80% of AdobeRGB 1998, whereas an RGBLED backlit display that appears in some Windows notebooks can display the entire gamut and then some.

http://www.anandtech.com/show/4205/the-macbook-pro-review-13-and-15-inch-2011-brings-sandy-bridge/10

3) All file systems are subject to fragmentation, and HFS+ is no exception. Nor is ext4, Linux users. Anyone who claims that ""defragmenting"" is only necessary on Windows is full of baloney. It's as necessary on ever OS as it is on another.

**edit**: As revealed by user ""moneybags0"", the way in which HFS+ deals with storage allocation may prolong file fragmentation until the disk is relatively full and void of contiguous free space. So, I would still claim that defragmentation is necessary under OS X, but perhaps to a somewhat lesser extent.

It should also be noted, however, that by default Windows 7 (and perhaps Vista) have automatic, schedule disk defragmentation enabled. This is hardly a problem that an end user has to worry about. I for one don't, and my computer runs smooth as butter.

**edit**: As tsdguy notes
> Defragmentation talk is nonsense. It affects 1% of computer users so whether any OS implements it perfectly or runs it in the background or whatever has NO effect on the experience by any user.

4) Many Windows machines are less expensive because they are subsidized by the inclusion of crapware. This is one area where I feel Apple shines. Why? Because they include no crapware.

There are a few companies that also offer ""clean"" experiences, Sony being one of them, but admittedly only on machines running Windows 7 Professional.

Windows machines purchased through Microsoft's few retail stores or their online store are also ""optimized"" and include no trialware, including only Zune, Windows Live Essentials and a few other programs.

5) Warranty: I have heard many stories of Apple replacing cracked displays. Don't count on it though, because it is NOT expressly covered by your warranty. In fact, it is outright stated that it will NOT be covered, nor will any form of accidental damage.

I owned a 2008 MacBook Pro, which many users have reported having hinge issues with, and due to extensive use, the display began to..well, tear itself asunder. When I brought it to my local Apple Store, they claimed I must have damaged it, and pointed out a minute scratch (not a dent, not something carved into it, a small scratch, likely from rubbing against a surface when it was opened). No coverage, $600+ repair.

Now, I'm not saying that any other company wouldn't have tried to screw me over either, but at least with them, their warranties offered at a similar price to AppleCare DO offer protection for Accidental Damage from Handling, if it were judged to be such.

**edit**: Yes, my story is an anecdote, just like any other. But I enjoy having the option to purchase a more comprehensive service plan than relying on chance. For this reason, my family's Macs were purchased at BestBuy with their BlackTie warranty program as well.

~~In terms of companies with strong retail presences, Sony is competitive with Apple, and you can bring your VAIO right into a Sony Style store.~~

I've been using Windows my whole life (still do for work) and then switched to OSX about five years back. It's been fantastic ever since. Like you said, it's lovely to simply use the machine rather than tinker with it. Over the past 20 years I've watched my father insistently fool around with his PCs. Building his own, upgrading every few months, defragging, reformatting, etc. In a way, I really just think he likes having something to do, because I never see him do anything on the computer other than browsing the Internet for information and deals (something he is very, very good at) or emailing.

Anyway, I initially replied to say that getting an iMac has been a wonderful experience (have had it for three years on top of the MacBook I got five years ago). It was fantastic for school as a design student because it was relatively easy to move around from house to house to apartment when that time came and it had the power I needed to do 3D modelling of massive sections of cities in Sketchup and render it in Artlantis (urban design background). For me, it really does ""just work"" and I have no problem replacing my aging MacBook with an Air in the near future. I also have an iP4 and AppleTV. Some might say I'm a fanboy, but I do give every product a fair chance before a purchase. The Apple ecosystem right now just seems to be working very well and I haven't had a single complaint across any of these products.

**TL;DR** - Go to a place like Best Buy to see if they have any deals. I got my iMac for $600 less than sticker price because someone bought it, took it home, cut the tape, and returned it for some funky reason. Best Buy automatically drops the price on products that have been returned and opened, even if they haven't actually been used. At least, this was the case a few years back.",1313803165.0

But, see, I don't think the author is talking about you. You are an individual who is capable of justifying your premium purchase with well-found logic - someone who is, at times, a diamond in the rough among brand consumers.

There exist users out there (not just for Apple, I disagree with him on that) that merely buy products because it carries a logo and positively associates them with a culture of... whatever they think those brand users are like. People who, when asked why they bought an iPhone, can simply respond, ""['Cause it's better.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FL7yD-0pqZg)"" and nothing more. There are users like this out there, and while I disagree that Apple is the only brand with this kind of cult following, I do think that they perhaps have the biggest following of this type.

While you are technically correct that all file systems are prone to fragmentation, some handle it much more efficiently and effectively than others.  HFS+ has built-in functionality that protects against fragmentation and defragments on-the-fly.

For example, many applications simply rewrite small files (<20mb) each time they are saved.  This has very little effect on performance because of the small file size, and has the bonus effect of not fragmenting that file.  There are a handful of other conditions that rewrite files immediately, keeping them from fragmenting.  In addition, because hard drives are so much larger than they were in the past, HFS+ doesn't attempt to fill the small empty fragments until it absolutely needs them, keeping files contiguous.

HFS+ also uses caching (read-ahead, write-behind) which causes minor fragmentation to have very little effect on performance, meaning small fragments have essentially no need to be defragmented.

Finally, HFS+ uses delayed allocation, preventing a file from being written to disk until it has a better idea of the actual size of the file.  Rather than allocate many small pieces (fragmenting), the space can be allocated in one, contiguous segment.  Similarly, if a file is considered ""hot"" (accessed often) it is put in a separate, reserved space on the drive that has more contiguous space to allocate, allowing the file to not fragment as much.",1313803165.0

Sure, % of OS X running computers is low compared to Windows but it's not nothing. I'm sure many bad guys would love to have millions of OS X zombies to use. Funny how that's never happened.

Your statement that Windows malware is due to users installing pirated software is preposterous. The two most common vectors for Windows infection is a) drive-by infection from websites using either zero-day exploits or well known exploits that have never been patched by the user or b) exploits of 3rd party components (mostly Adobe brand).

MacDefender was over-hyped by the anti-Apple hateboy press. It never amounted to anything.

2) Your display obsession is irrelevant. Considering the number of PROFESSIONAL GRAPHICS people using Macs who seem happy your comments are worthless. Many graphics professional are well served by using Pantone color systems and a best display by a monitor. I worked at a professional media outlet for many years and EVERYONE used Macs, many iMacs and almost all Mac monitors. It was plenty good to produce hundreds of full color products. In all cases, the color proofs were almost exactly matching the original documents.

3) Defragmentation talk is nonsense. It affects 1% of computer users so whether any OS implements it perfectly or runs it in the background or whatever has NO effect on the experience by any user.

4) Price is irrelevant since Apple has little interest in the low price market nor in the low margin war. 

5) Hear many stories of any other company replacing equipment out of warranty? Nope. Your personal experience is worthless - did you try other Apple resources? 

You'll need to point out other companies where a STANDARD OR EXTENDED warranty covers misuse from handling? Sure you can buy the ""fix it for any reason"" warranty but thats not a standard warranty.

iPads and Macs are getting so close that it’s becoming difficult to see where one should end and the other should begin.

Apple has been insisting for years that the product lines are no merging, but that’s clearly the path they’re on. The most recent examples of this are the Big Sur redesign, the merging industrial designs, and of course, the M1 processor. We also saw iPadsOS shift from a tab-based UI to a sidebar-based UI last year, like the Mac, and of course, there was the added mouse/trackpad support last year. 

The next steps I see in this merger are:

* iPadOS 15 gets Big Sur style icons
* iPads get a more comprehensive system for external monitor support and Mac connectivity
* iPadOS 15 gets a redesigned multitasking system and a new Home Screen that make it more Mac-like
* Professional Software from the Mac finally makes its way over to the iPad

I could potentially see all of that happening this year.",1618948608.0

If your living on campus You could just get an iPad to take notes in class and do basic assignments on and use the schools computers when necessary. 

Also, don’t base you decision on a Reddit post. If you don’t know to difference between a iPad and MacBook you need to go to the store and use the apps in person or watch some YouTube videos on how the software you’ll need works on the different OS’s.

"Minutiae - the anti-social media app free from likes, comments, or profiles.","Hello folks,

Even though we take more photos than ever most of them are special moments - birthdays, dinner with friends, playing with our pets, etc.   


However, **99.9% of our lives go undocumented** because these moments seem too mundane or ordinary to be worthy of documentation.  


My co-creator and I created minutiae, an app the “forces” you to document these moments - before it’s too late. 

This is how it works:

* Once a day **at the exact same minute** all participants around the world receive a daily alert. 
* At the alert, you have **one minute to capture** whatever is in front of you there and then. 
* The result is thousands of complete strangers capturing ordinary moments of their life at the exact same time together creating a global ritual of self-documentation. 

Once you have captured your moment you have a one-minute window to view your own timeline of previously taken photos or with the tap of a button get matched with a complete stranger. The experience offers a **highly intimate view into a stranger’s life** before the app closes down and the process is repeated again the following day at a different minute. 

The project continues for 1440 days until every single minute in a day has been captured creating a highly unique journal of what ***really*** ***happened in life*** as opposed to what we tend to remember.

I have loved the experience and will definitely be giving it another whirl once I’ve finished. I’m also pretty proud of the fact that I’ve only missed 288 moments haha. 
- Loved being able to check out other people’s everyday pics from all over the world! That short 1min glimpse into their life is very cool. I almost feel it’s the same comparison to being a tourist somewhere vs living there. 
- On occasion when I have looked at a few of my old pics in the minute window I have been amazed at how many little things I have forgotten about my everyday life from that time that I would never have been reminded of otherwise. I’m not much of a photo taker normally so it’s nice to be “forced” to document my life in some way. 
- The only thing that bugs me is my shitty timing. I will have just gone out and done something super fun and interesting and the minute I get home the app goes off haha.

"Minutiae - the anti-social media app free from likes, comments, or profiles.","Hello folks,

Even though we take more photos than ever most of them are special moments - birthdays, dinner with friends, playing with our pets, etc.   


However, **99.9% of our lives go undocumented** because these moments seem too mundane or ordinary to be worthy of documentation.  


My co-creator and I created minutiae, an app the “forces” you to document these moments - before it’s too late. 

This is how it works:

* Once a day **at the exact same minute** all participants around the world receive a daily alert. 
* At the alert, you have **one minute to capture** whatever is in front of you there and then. 
* The result is thousands of complete strangers capturing ordinary moments of their life at the exact same time together creating a global ritual of self-documentation. 

Once you have captured your moment you have a one-minute window to view your own timeline of previously taken photos or with the tap of a button get matched with a complete stranger. The experience offers a **highly intimate view into a stranger’s life** before the app closes down and the process is repeated again the following day at a different minute. 

The project continues for 1440 days until every single minute in a day has been captured creating a highly unique journal of what ***really*** ***happened in life*** as opposed to what we tend to remember.

I always thought the project was a one-off. Reading this thread it sounds as if you're still signing up new users and starting new four-year clocks. 

Is this right? That would be great! I've refrained from talking about mi:nu:ti:ae last year or two; didn't want people to come in with no chance to fill in missing shots. 

Really love your project and hope it is a rolling four-years. Can't wait to order my book in 46 days. (And buy a new subscription and start over!)

BTW, I had to do some Google-fu to find this thread and the AMA--how about some links from the site's web page?",1615138571.0

Cannot wait to get my first book! 

And on that note (1st book)--PLEASE please please don't shut down this app if possible! I would love to get at least two books worth of snapshots (tbh, I'd be giddy to use this app the rest of my life lol 😁) 

Once my first cycle is up, do I have to do anything to start the next one? Or will it begin automatically?

Yes, I never used 1 Second myself but I heard people comparing minutiae to it even though minutiae is perhaps a little more absolutist in its approach :) 

Minutiae is actually the result of a failed photography project I did a few years ago where I tried to explore a very complex theme and realized that as a single photographer I would never be able to capture the true nature of what I had set out to do.   


I met Daniel my co-creator and we began talking about the importance of documenting the ordinary ""in-between"" moments of life and realized that we should build an app (everyone carries a phone with them) as a way to achieve it -  it eventually resulted in this weird little app :)",1615138571.0

Even though we take more photos than ever most of them are special moments - birthdays, dinner with friends, playing with our pets, etc.   


However, **99.9% of our lives go undocumented** because these moments seem too mundane or ordinary to be worthy of documentation.  


My co-creator and I created minutiae, an app the “forces” you to document these moments - before it’s too late. 

This is how it works:

* Once a day **at the exact same minute** all participants around the world receive a daily alert. 
* At the alert, you have **one minute to capture** whatever is in front of you there and then. 
* The result is thousands of complete strangers capturing ordinary moments of their life at the exact same time together creating a global ritual of self-documentation. 

Once you have captured your moment you have a one-minute window to view your own timeline of previously taken photos or with the tap of a button get matched with a complete stranger. The experience offers a **highly intimate view into a stranger’s life** before the app closes down and the process is repeated again the following day at a different minute. 

The project continues for 1440 days until every single minute in a day has been captured creating a highly unique journal of what ***really*** ***happened in life*** as opposed to what we tend to remember.

Even though we take more photos than ever most of them are special moments - birthdays, dinner with friends, playing with our pets, etc.   


However, **99.9% of our lives go undocumented** because these moments seem too mundane or ordinary to be worthy of documentation.  


My co-creator and I created minutiae, an app the “forces” you to document these moments - before it’s too late. 

This is how it works:

* Once a day **at the exact same minute** all participants around the world receive a daily alert. 
* At the alert, you have **one minute to capture** whatever is in front of you there and then. 
* The result is thousands of complete strangers capturing ordinary moments of their life at the exact same time together creating a global ritual of self-documentation. 

Once you have captured your moment you have a one-minute window to view your own timeline of previously taken photos or with the tap of a button get matched with a complete stranger. The experience offers a **highly intimate view into a stranger’s life** before the app closes down and the process is repeated again the following day at a different minute. 

The project continues for 1440 days until every single minute in a day has been captured creating a highly unique journal of what ***really*** ***happened in life*** as opposed to what we tend to remember.

At the time I took this I had about 3 months left, so you can see there are spaces that are empty. The times where it went off in the night were just suppressed by DND on my phone and are basically filled in as black missing shots. (You can see missing shots within the day as well when I didn’t catch the notification in time) Sometimes I’m traveling and in a different timezone, or I’m actually awake at an ungodly hour, so every once in a while you’ll see a hit in the evening hours. In reality, it’s not a huge deal.

The following day the opposite might happen depending on the time of the alert.",1615138571.0
"Minutiae - the anti-social media app free from likes, comments, or profiles.","Hello folks,

Even though we take more photos than ever most of them are special moments - birthdays, dinner with friends, playing with our pets, etc.   


However, **99.9% of our lives go undocumented** because these moments seem too mundane or ordinary to be worthy of documentation.  


My co-creator and I created minutiae, an app the “forces” you to document these moments - before it’s too late. 

This is how it works:

* Once a day **at the exact same minute** all participants around the world receive a daily alert. 
* At the alert, you have **one minute to capture** whatever is in front of you there and then. 
* The result is thousands of complete strangers capturing ordinary moments of their life at the exact same time together creating a global ritual of self-documentation. 

Once you have captured your moment you have a one-minute window to view your own timeline of previously taken photos or with the tap of a button get matched with a complete stranger. The experience offers a **highly intimate view into a stranger’s life** before the app closes down and the process is repeated again the following day at a different minute. 

The project continues for 1440 days until every single minute in a day has been captured creating a highly unique journal of what ***really*** ***happened in life*** as opposed to what we tend to remember.

If you're providing legitimate feedback then, yes, voice your opinion. That will help ensure the developer has a wider view on what is working and what isn't. But most of the upvoted comments (at the time of commenting) was this idea is stupid, there's a reason this stuff goes undocumented, and ultimately attacking the underlying thesis for the app itself. 

So, I'll tweak my stance, if you don't like it and can articulate why you don't like it in a respectful and meaningful way, then by all means... But if you're just here because a ""different"" idea challenges your idea of what social media ""should be"", then you might as well keep your mouth shut.

My Mac Mini order was cancelled by Apple because an update is expected soon,"We ordered a Mac Mini for me at work 3 weeks ago. The delivery date kept being pushed back (since it has 16Gb RAM it's a custom made order) until today where we received a text from Apple. The order has been canceled because a update of this product is expected soon (they encourage us to place another order later).

I'm just posting that here so you know (it seems you can still buy a Mac Mini that's in stock, but if I were you I would just wait a few weeks). It's worth noting that I'm in France we ordered online on the french Apple website.

**Edit:** Some people are asking that I post a screenshot of the text. I honestly wasn't expecting:

- the whole thing to be something out of the ordinary
- so many people answering and being surprised

The text was received by my boss, I didn't read it. When he told me about it he said he deleted it manually. I'll ask tomorrow again if he's sure of what he read and if somehow he can still retrieve the text to check it again.

**Edit 2:** I had a discussion with my 2 bosses involved in ordering the Mac and the exact reason was (in the email, in french) ""Reconstruction de gamme"" (which means something like ""rebuilding the range [of Mac Minis I guess]"").

And yes, Apple did cancel the order (weird indeed), my boss got a refund and got told (by email) that he can either order something not custom (in stock) or either wait to be recontacted later by Apple.

Another hint that something is happening is that when you order on the website (at least on the french store), a fully maxed Mac Mini is advertised to be delivered in **2-3 days** but when you do the ""delivery date simulation"" (or whatever you call it in english) it actually goes to **16-20 October!** (see the screenshot below for proof)

http://imgur.com/XD9tFqY

Try it yourself if you don't believe me: http://www.apple.com/fr/shop/buy-mac/mac-mini?product=MGEN2F/A&step=config#

So you can order something in stock straigthaway but as soon as you want something custom you have crazy delays.

And no I didn't ask to see the email, I do trust them (they wouldn't be the kind of people to lie about that, and one is quite a follower of Apple news and very surprised and intrigued about that too). They even offered to re-order today (for delivery on 16-20 Oct) or even order one that's in stock, but I'd rather wait a week or too and see (I don't want to miss any update).",194,PLOT TWIST: The boss actually made it up to justify that he forgot to order it in the first place and/or his money laundry scheme. /s,1444241047.0

My Mac Mini order was cancelled by Apple because an update is expected soon,"We ordered a Mac Mini for me at work 3 weeks ago. The delivery date kept being pushed back (since it has 16Gb RAM it's a custom made order) until today where we received a text from Apple.

I'm just posting that here so you know (it seems you can still buy a Mac Mini that's in stock, but if I were you I would just wait a few weeks). It's worth noting that I'm in France we ordered online on the french Apple website.

The text was received by my boss, I didn't read it. When he told me about it he said he deleted it manually. I'll ask tomorrow again if he's sure of what he read and if somehow he can still retrieve the text to check it again.

**Edit 2:** I had a discussion with my 2 bosses involved in ordering the Mac and the exact reason was (in the email, in french) ""Reconstruction de gamme"" (which means something like ""rebuilding the range [of Mac Minis I guess]"").

And yes, Apple did cancel the order (weird indeed), my boss got a refund and got told (by email) that he can either order something not custom (in stock) or either wait to be recontacted later by Apple.

Another hint that something is happening is that when you order on the website (at least on the french store), a fully maxed Mac Mini is advertised to be delivered in **2-3 days** but when you do the ""delivery date simulation"" (or whatever you call it in english) it actually goes to **16-20 October!** (see the screenshot below for proof)

My Mac Mini order was cancelled by Apple because an update is expected soon,"We ordered a Mac Mini for me at work 3 weeks ago. The delivery date kept being pushed back (since it has 16Gb RAM it's a custom made order) until today where we received a text from Apple.

I'm just posting that here so you know (it seems you can still buy a Mac Mini that's in stock, but if I were you I would just wait a few weeks). It's worth noting that I'm in France we ordered online on the french Apple website.

- the whole thing to be something out of the ordinary
- so many people answering and being surprised

The text was received by my boss, I didn't read it. When he told me about it he said he deleted it manually. I'll ask tomorrow again if he's sure of what he read and if somehow he can still retrieve the text to check it again.

**Edit 2:** I had a discussion with my 2 bosses involved in ordering the Mac and the exact reason was (in the email, in french) ""Reconstruction de gamme"" (which means something like ""rebuilding the range [of Mac Minis I guess]"").

And yes, Apple did cancel the order (weird indeed), my boss got a refund and got told (by email) that he can either order something not custom (in stock) or either wait to be recontacted later by Apple.

Another hint that something is happening is that when you order on the website (at least on the french store), a fully maxed Mac Mini is advertised to be delivered in **2-3 days** but when you do the ""delivery date simulation"" (or whatever you call it in english) it actually goes to **16-20 October!** (see the screenshot below for proof)

The text was received by my boss, I didn't read it. When he told me about it he said he deleted it manually. I'll ask tomorrow again if he's sure of what he read and if somehow he can still retrieve the text to check it again.

**Edit 2:** I had a discussion with my 2 bosses involved in ordering the Mac and the exact reason was (in the email, in french) ""Reconstruction de gamme"" (which means something like ""rebuilding the range [of Mac Minis I guess]"").

Another hint that something is happening is that when you order on the website (at least on the french store), a fully maxed Mac Mini is advertised to be delivered in **2-3 days** but when you do the ""delivery date simulation"" (or whatever you call it in english) it actually goes to **16-20 October!** (see the screenshot below for proof)

For its intended use (home theater center), I didn't need the power of the latest model but the 2012 has vastly more upgrade versatility.

If you have a stock 2012 and the CPU + graphics performance is sufficient for your needs, these are the things you can do to it:

- Upgrade RAM, up to 16GB

- Replace the hard drive with an SSD

- Add a second internal hard drive or SSD

So far I have left my 2012 Mini RAM at its original level because it is enough for my needs. But we started to run out of space to store recorded TV shows. I added a second drive for the $28 cost of the [OWC Data Doubler kit](http://eshop.macsales.com/item/OWC/DIYIMM11D2/). The 500GB drive I added was ""free"" because I had taken it out of an old laptop and it was just sitting on the shelf.

Most of the above is impossible with the latest Minis. You are stuck with the way it came from Apple, so you have to anticipate all future upgrades and must include them at order time with Apple parts at Apple prices. The only upgrade that is possible is that if you bought the current base model Mini with the hard drive, you can replace it with a common SATA SSD.

My Mac Mini order was cancelled by Apple because an update is expected soon,"We ordered a Mac Mini for me at work 3 weeks ago. The delivery date kept being pushed back (since it has 16Gb RAM it's a custom made order) until today where we received a text from Apple. The order has been canceled because a update of this product is expected soon (they encourage us to place another order later).

I'm just posting that here so you know (it seems you can still buy a Mac Mini that's in stock, but if I were you I would just wait a few weeks). It's worth noting that I'm in France we ordered online on the french Apple website.

**Edit:** Some people are asking that I post a screenshot of the text. I honestly wasn't expecting:

- the whole thing to be something out of the ordinary
- so many people answering and being surprised

The text was received by my boss, I didn't read it. When he told me about it he said he deleted it manually. I'll ask tomorrow again if he's sure of what he read and if somehow he can still retrieve the text to check it again.

**Edit 2:** I had a discussion with my 2 bosses involved in ordering the Mac and the exact reason was (in the email, in french) ""Reconstruction de gamme"" (which means something like ""rebuilding the range [of Mac Minis I guess]"").

And yes, Apple did cancel the order (weird indeed), my boss got a refund and got told (by email) that he can either order something not custom (in stock) or either wait to be recontacted later by Apple.

Another hint that something is happening is that when you order on the website (at least on the french store), a fully maxed Mac Mini is advertised to be delivered in **2-3 days** but when you do the ""delivery date simulation"" (or whatever you call it in english) it actually goes to **16-20 October!** (see the screenshot below for proof)

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer. You are welcome to feel however you want about that, but I personally am really fond of this approach. USB-C stuff is still *outrageously expensive,* but that doesn't mean it isn't superior (I believe it is, I'll take USB-PD over Magsafe any day). There are some of us out there that really love this computer. It's not all bad. 

I encourage all of you to get outside your comfort zone with your computers. We tend to not like going out of our ways to build new computing habits (I'm looking at you, all you traditional scrolling heathens /s), but the computer is a tool. Learn how you work best with it, and just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's a bad product. I happen to know that a large number of people, if not a majority, doesn't like this new keyboard, but it also seems to be related to how long you've been around computing. Be aware of that; sticks in the mud still use Windows XP and/or Tiger.

Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care.

I look forward rebuttal to the rebuttal :)",127,"I am an author. I type for a *living*. I'm a huge apple cheerleader and I own a crapload of their products. On my desk right now is a MacBook air, my 2015 (prior-generation keyboard A1502) MacBook pro, an iMac retina, an iPad, my iPhone x, my apple AirPods, my apple watch, a magic trackpad, a magic trackpad 2. I LOVE my apple devices.

Usually when a new apple device comes out, I'm first in line to buy it. I want the absolute best device at my fingertips. Money is no object. When author friends ask what to buy, I always pointed them straight at apple devices and unabashedly told them they are the absolute best writing machine for this business. I've probably helped Apple sell dozens of MacBook Pros and Airs (perhaps even *hundreds* of devices) as a result. Word of mouth matters.

The new MacBook Pro? I tell EVERYONE to stay away from it. 

The keyboard is inexcusably bad for typing anything more than a facebook wall post. It's not just a matter of getting used to it. The low profile/travel keys are a recipe for hand-cramp disaster. I tried it for a week and a half. I already deal with a little carpal tunnel and a few days on the new MBP is enough to make me want to tear my hands off. Even if we ignore the reliability issues ([a speck of dust just broke your spacebar, pay us $330-$700 to repair it] (https://theoutline.com/post/2402/the-new-macbook-keyboard-is-ruining-my-life?zd=1&zi=i4l7pg2j)), it's still a *total* ergonomic disaster. It's like they designed it specifically to hurt you.

All of the experimenting you're discussing doesn't make this device better. My prior-gen MacBook can plug into any USB device ever made, has an HDMI port (I'll be using that in a few weeks to plug into a projector for a conference), has an SD port, and the magsafe power adapter has saved my device at least half a dozen times over the years. Oh... and it has a keyboard I can actually use to type a novel without spending weeks nursing an RSI injury.

I could look most of those issues. I could buy my dongles and suck it up. I could learn to love the Touch Bar (it might even be useful for some basic use in my writing software). I could adapt to those new wacky tiny USB ports. I could accept the loss of my SD card slot. If the new MacBook Pro was genuinely a step forward in some major way, I could ignore ALL of those flaws.

But it's not a step forward in any way! It gets roughly similar battery life as the outgoing model, has similar performance, and has the worst keyboard I've ever experienced on a high-end laptop. In virtually **every single objective way**, it's a straight downgrade (or side-grade at best). There is nothing the new MacBook does appreciably better than the old one. Not one single solitary thing that makes up for the downsides.

And there are lots of things it does *absolutely* worse. Horrifically worse. Like typing anything longer than a facebook wall post.

I'll accept that you like the new keyboard. For whatever reason, it works great for your typing style. Maybe you're younger and you're used to typing on a hard screen - whereas I'm older and I cut my teeth on typewriters and do most of my typing on a mechanical keyboard. I can imagine that leading to differences in appreciation of a no-key-travel keyboard (although, I'd suggest you don't use it to type a novel or ten, because I'm telling you that you'll end up hurting at the end of it). Even so, you've **already** had your keyboard replaced by Apple because of its reliability issues, and that's just not acceptable. Keyboards need to be bombproof, and the prior-gen apple MacBook Pro keyboard **absolutely** was. Odds are pretty good I'll still be banging novels out on my prior-gen MacBook pro in 2020 and beyond. Can you say the same about the new MacBook Pro? Once AppleCare expires on that thing, you're going to be facing one hell of an expensive repair if so much as a dust bunny gets under the spacebar. And don't think it won't happen. Keyboards get dirty. A few years of oil and grime and hair and skin and dust will build up no matter how clean you are.

It's pretty sad that even the people defending this keyboard decision admit that they're having keyboard issues :(. Even if you love the keyboard, the reliability issues are unacceptable.  

To put it simply... the new MacBook is a giant leap in the wrong direction.",1518153995.0

The screen, speakers and keyboard are my top favorites 

The trackpad, USBC and the touchbar and battery don’t do much for me.

Trackpad - it’s just too large. It does not get in my way but it just does not need to be that large.

Trackpad - the top layer of coating wore off quickly and I can see where I mostly tap on it. My older MacBook never had that. It’s not end of the world.

USB C. I don’t live the dongle life but they literally could have put a USB A in this or a SD slot. I get by fine still.

Touchbar - I barely touch it. I use better touch tool, my custom layout is perfect. But really, it’s just a gimmick. Apple did nothing with High Sierra to expand upon it. So even they know it’s a gimmick.

Battery, it’s not much better than my old MacBook. On Sierra it was worse. High Sierra improved upon that so I’m okay with the battery now but it’s still not a step up. 


Still. All in all I’m happy. It’s just not as mind blowing as previous versions but it’s a light and fast piece of kit that gets my dev world done .

Had been so scared by what I'd read online about the keyboard that I didn't even consider it until I'd already bought a Macbook Air and been so disappointed with the screen that I returned it.

Anyway, when my refurbed Macbook arrived in the mail and I used it for the first time, I loved it almost right away, which I was not at all expecting. The reason it won me over is I'm a gentle and speedy typer and, with any other keyboard, I get missed keystrokes. Never been a problem with this one, even the lightest touches register. Plus the big keys have improved my accuracy to the point where I almost never mess up a stroke.

Use it daily for my work in all kinds of environments and while I'm generally careful, I don't baby the computer - had no issues with dust etc.

From my point of view, all the hate on the keyboard is a wash. Each to their own, though. If you can't get used to the new ones, Apple has left you out to dry.

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2.

I have mx cherry blue switches at home and work, and have used browns and reds for years in the past. Like any different switch keyboard there’s a learning curve to using it. 


I feel like people get upset just because it isn’t exactly like it was before, and just because it’s Apple. There’s some weird internet expectation that Apple will design every product specifically for people with very niche needs that will (obviously) never be met.

I thought about this a lot. But old habits die hard.

I use the App Switcher a lot. If they took away the *CMD + Tab* and made me use something newer like Expose or Mission Control, I'd be up in arms too. 

I think the touch bar should have been a row above the Function keys and everyone would have been happy. Add functionality, but don't harm other people's workflow.

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow.""

While I don't have any first hand experience with this, here's my theory about the keyboard cover: you will actually have a better experience with a keyboard cover on the newer MacBooks than the older ones, *because* of the less key travel. One thing I've always hated about the older ones is their tendency to drag the entire cover with your keystrokes, and with the reduced travel, that shouldn't happen as often and it shouldn't move. As a bonus, those large key caps allow for there to be plenty of surface area for the cover to grab.

Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer. You are welcome to feel however you want about that, but I personally am really fond of this approach. USB-C stuff is still *outrageously expensive,* but that doesn't mean it isn't superior (I believe it is, I'll take USB-PD over Magsafe any day).

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care.

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer. You are welcome to feel however you want about that, but I personally am really fond of this approach. USB-C stuff is still *outrageously expensive,* but that doesn't mean it isn't superior (I believe it is, I'll take USB-PD over Magsafe any day). There are some of us out there that really love this computer. It's not all bad.

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer. You are welcome to feel however you want about that, but I personally am really fond of this approach. USB-C stuff is still *outrageously expensive,* but that doesn't mean it isn't superior (I believe it is, I'll take USB-PD over Magsafe any day). There are some of us out there that really love this computer. It's not all bad. 

I encourage all of you to get outside your comfort zone with your computers. We tend to not like going out of our ways to build new computing habits (I'm looking at you, all you traditional scrolling heathens /s), but the computer is a tool. Learn how you work best with it, and just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's a bad product. I happen to know that a large number of people, if not a majority, doesn't like this new keyboard, but it also seems to be related to how long you've been around computing. Be aware of that; sticks in the mud still use Windows XP and/or Tiger.

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer. You are welcome to feel however you want about that, but I personally am really fond of this approach. USB-C stuff is still *outrageously expensive,* but that doesn't mean it isn't superior (I believe it is, I'll take USB-PD over Magsafe any day). There are some of us out there that really love this computer. It's not all bad. 

I encourage all of you to get outside your comfort zone with your computers. We tend to not like going out of our ways to build new computing habits (I'm looking at you, all you traditional scrolling heathens /s), but the computer is a tool. Learn how you work best with it, and just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's a bad product. I happen to know that a large number of people, if not a majority, doesn't like this new keyboard, but it also seems to be related to how long you've been around computing. Be aware of that; sticks in the mud still use Windows XP and/or Tiger.

Many adapters aren’t overly expensive either. You can get USB-A to USB-C ones pretty cheap on Amazon, and prices will only go down now that other companies like Dell are making USB-C/TB3 only machines.

Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard.

I'm not saying there aren't people who will be happy with the new MacBook. If you love it, that's great, but it doesn't invalidate what I'm saying here. Removal of ""pro"" features (like a freaking standard USB port/HDMI port/magsafe charging port) and the addition of a keyboard that stops functioning if a speck of dust gets under the keys? That's not exactly a giant leap forward.

There is nothing a new MacBook can do that my prior-gen can't, and there's plenty of things I can do right now with my prior-gen MacBook that you can't do with a new one (at least, not without some extra dongles hanging out the side). 

Maybe you love the low-profile keys and nonexistent key feedback, but I don't see how you could feel good about the reliability issues.

At the end of the day, use what makes you happy. I'm sticking with my prior-gen because it is, to this day, the best MacBook ever made. It's a joy to type on, it functions as a pro machine with actual functional ports, it has magsafe, and it's cosmetically nearly identical to the new model.

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever.

Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

People didn't stop using CD/DVD drives because flash drives provided a more convenient experience.

People will stop using USB-A when USB-C provides a better/more convenient experience.

If the only way new technology would take hold is through limited the consumers and not providing them a better experience then that's bad.

Oh please.

5 years ago I bought a Nokia Lumia 920. A Windows Phone. It came with 2 chargers; standard wired charger, and a wireless one. This was 5 years ago. My iPhone X sits on my Windows Phone charger at work, in a proud respect to Nokia.

There happens to be 3 Apple chargers next to where I sit. At least one is always available. But no. Not for me. They are USB-C only. So the X uses the Windows Phone charger.

Of course anytime I go out I've got my headphone dongle hanging out of my pocket.

Half the office have a 2017 Macbook. Lovely machine. But every one, every single one of them, has a dongle. Many have two. They can't even use display port because they bought cheap dongles. The rest of the office? Not a single dongle. The 2015 Macbook guys are fine. Didn't need it, so they didn't ask. They plug straight into the monitor and use that as their USB hub. Can't on a 2017 Macbook.

This is the reality of Apple pushing the industry forward. I'm not against change, but Apple really dropped the ball on how they transitioned.

tl;dr; They were late with wireless. Lightning needs to die. Dongle life is dumb.",1518153995.0

Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer.

There are some of us out there that really love this computer. It's not all bad. 

I encourage all of you to get outside your comfort zone with your computers. We tend to not like going out of our ways to build new computing habits (I'm looking at you, all you traditional scrolling heathens /s), but the computer is a tool.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things.

In terms of connecting your phone to your computer or using headphones, these are things that Apple is pushing wireless, instead of physical connection. And I doubt Lightning will “take over” on other devices because it’s Apple’s port for iOS devices, and is proprietary. 

Edit: And many of these legacy ports do “hold you back” when it comes to thinness, something Apple has been aiming for for years, since the 13” MBP is as thick as a USB-A port on its edges. ",1518153995.0
Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever.

I look forward rebuttal to the rebuttal :)",127,"“Stuff that should be built in”? By whose decree? Yours? And how big exactly is your big bag of dongles? Are we talking hiking backpack? Because my dongles really don’t require that much space... they easily fit in the accessories pocket on my fairly minimalist laptop bag.

This is of course subjective, but here’s my perspective: Things I do use, but very seldom.. I’d rather have as a dongle than integrated in my computer. For 95% of the time (working at my company office where everything is airplay compatible and with good WiFi-coverage) I have a computer that is lighter and thinner. I generally carry it between different meeting rooms and my desk all day, so portability is always a priority feature for me). And same at home. In my laptop bag I keep an Ethernet and “legacy video” dongle, so they’re always there when I go to a client meeting in another location. When I travel for vacations e.t.c I don’t bring all that, because every ounce less weight in my carryon is preferred (I love walking between location in cities if there’s time, and a lighter laptop makes that more comfortable). Apples mentality fits incredibly well for my use cases and preferences. And getting rid of legacy stuff helps them keep pushing that progress forward. A few grams here, and a few millimeters there for every new iteration and generation. And that adds up a lot when you go maybe 4-5 years between hardware upgrades. Those grams have added up to ounces.. or even pounds. 

Needing a few dongles that I myself can always choose to either bring, or not bring is a better fit for me. Realistically, I use a dongle maybe once a month. At my desk I have an Ethernet dongle Permanently attached to the Ethernet cable there, but can’t really remember when I last had to use it. If there’s temporary WiFi issues, I can easily just use personal hotspot on my 4G phone.

So yeah, it’s not your use case. That doesn’t make it objectively wrong. Because it absolutely fits my use case, and I interact with the rest of the world just fine.

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer.

Perhaps just my own style has changed in the way manufacturers want, but I haven’t used a USB drive in YEARS. And neither have my friends. My friends use Google Docs, myself Microsoft OneDrive, others still use iCloud.

For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer. You are welcome to feel however you want about that, but I personally am really fond of this approach. USB-C stuff is still *outrageously expensive,* but that doesn't mean it isn't superior (I believe it is, I'll take USB-PD over Magsafe any day). There are some of us out there that really love this computer. It's not all bad.

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December.

Rebuttal: The MacBook Pro 2017 gives me a case of the butterflies each time I use it (pun intended),"This is intended to be a rebuttal post to [this excellent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/7w781l/i_downgraded_from_a_2017_macbook_pro_to_a_2015/) by /u/frizzyfox.

Let me begin by saying: the MacBook Pro 2017 is obviously held back by the lack of its keyboard appeal. The masses just don't want it for the lack of the function keys (touchbar, more on that a little later), and the keys themselves. 

It would probably help if I specify my use case: I'm a college student who writes  notes on my computer, and I sometimeslike to write code every now and then. I have very recently started using an app called [Typora](http://typora.io) to write my notes really quickly with markdown. I'm frequently reaching all across the keyboard to type in weird, markdown specific things, like Latex math commands, `| Table | Entries |` and more. I also write some code, some ordinary papers, and other normal things. 

The massive keys are a *godsend*. Coming from a 2011 MacBook Air I was using, these keys are an absolute dream. Not only are they crazy responsive in spite of the low travel, I have gotten amazingly fast at using them; typing speed tests show that I am about 10 WPM faster from my usual 70, all the way up to 120 WPM with this keyboard. I am so fast using this keyboard, in fact, that sometimes my thoughts need to catch up... ^(like right now). 

The reliability issues with the keyboard are real though, and I don't recommend that anyone get this computer without Apple Care. Over the winter break, my computer had to be taken somewhere in TN for them to replace the keyboard. I can notice a difference between this one and the last one though. I bought my computer in mid-2017, and it was replaced in December. Listening to the Accidental Tech Podcast and how they've discussed how Apple can change out parts without changing the model number, I think it's possible that many of you are out in the world with a what would be a generation 2.0 butterfly keyboard, and I now have 2.1 or 2.2. 

Now the Touch Bar: I use it ***every day.*** It's usually for `CMD + Shift + 4` and specifying where the screenshot should go, but in other cases it's genuinely useful. For instance, Markdown is GREAT but sometimes I just don't understand it, like tables. Apps can add buttons that would make complicated things easier. Here's some cases like that with Typora:

* After defining the headers for my table, Typora helpfully gives me options to tap and add a row. It's right above where my `1` key is.
* After making a flowchart, I can tap `OK` and it will exit the code entry box.
* I can quickly tap into code view and manipulate the markdown behind the preview without having to move my hands to do the `CMD +/`

If none of this feels like a rebuttal, consider this the official time: I'm in *love* with this computer, and it will probably be my favorite computer ever. The effectiveness of this computer entirely depends on your workflow, and if you're trying to use your 2012 workflow with a 2017 computer, there's going to be some conflict. Some of you will disagree with how Apple has decided to move forward with their Mac line, and might even feel like they're declaring war on your workflows. I would partially agree with that in light of their recent acquisition of an app literally called ""Workflow."" 

If something on your phone goes away -- the headphone jack, your home button, etc -- you're more inclined to adapt. Apple is experimenting with doing the same thing with your computer. You are welcome to feel however you want about that, but I personally am really fond of this approach. USB-C stuff is still *outrageously expensive,* but that doesn't mean it isn't superior (I believe it is, I'll take USB-PD over Magsafe any day). There are some of us out there that really love this computer. It's not all bad. 

I encourage all of you to get outside your comfort zone with your computers. We tend to not like going out of our ways to build new computing habits (I'm looking at you, all you traditional scrolling heathens /s), but the computer is a tool. Learn how you work best with it, and just because you don't like it doesn't mean it's a bad product.

Sorry meant the Surface Laptop. How come it's thinner than the Macbook Pro 13"" and has a USB-A?
